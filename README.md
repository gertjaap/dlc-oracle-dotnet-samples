# Examples of using the Discreet Log Contract Oracle library (.NET Core)

This repository contains examples of using the DLC Oracle library to create oracles in .NET Core.

* [Console](console/) - A simple example of using the code by getting the values to sign from the console.
* [Test](test/) - A command line utility that uses the testdata output from the [Go Testgenerator](https://github.com/mit-dci/dlc-oracle-go) to verify the library produces the same signatures as the reference implementation in Go.

Did you create any fun samples you'd like to share? Feel free to send a pull request.
